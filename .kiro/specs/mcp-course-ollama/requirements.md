# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This pedagogical course aims to teach developers how to build and integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers and Clients using Ollama for local LLM deployment. The course emphasizes privacy-by-design principles by keeping all AI processing local, while providing comprehensive understanding of MCP architecture, components, and practical implementation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning MCP, I want to understand the fundamental concepts and architecture, so that I can build my own MCP integrations with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner accesses the course THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of MCP Server, MCP Client, tools, resources, and prompts concepts
2. WHEN a learner studies the architecture THEN the system SHALL illustrate the interaction flow between user, LLM, and MCP Servers with diagrams
3. WHEN a learner completes the conceptual section THEN the system SHALL ensure they understand the role of each component in the MCP ecosystem

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious developer, I want to learn how to use Ollama for local LLM processing, so that I can build MCP applications without sending data to external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner studies Ollama integration THEN the system SHALL explain how to set up and configure Ollama for local LLM hosting
2. WHEN a learner implements MCP with Ollama THEN the system SHALL demonstrate privacy-by-design principles and data locality
3. WHEN a learner configures the system THEN the system SHALL ensure all AI processing remains on the local machine

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hands-on learner, I want practical examples and exercises, so that I can implement MCP Servers and Clients myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner progresses through the course THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step tutorials for building MCP Servers
2. WHEN a learner implements examples THEN the system SHALL include working code samples for MCP Client integration
3. WHEN a learner completes exercises THEN the system SHALL offer progressive complexity from basic to advanced implementations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer building MCP tools, I want to understand how to create and expose tools and resources, so that I can extend LLM capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner studies MCP tools THEN the system SHALL explain how to define, implement, and expose custom tools
2. WHEN a learner works with resources THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how to provide structured data access to LLMs
3. WHEN a learner implements functionality THEN the system SHALL show best practices for tool and resource design

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a course participant, I want interactive learning materials and assessments, so that I can validate my understanding and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner engages with content THEN the system SHALL provide interactive code examples and exercises
2. WHEN a learner completes modules THEN the system SHALL offer knowledge checks and practical assessments
3. WHEN a learner finishes sections THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide feedback on implementation quality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educator or self-learner, I want well-structured course materials, so that I can follow a logical learning progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learner accesses the course THEN the system SHALL organize content in logical modules from basics to advanced topics
2. WHEN a learner navigates content THEN the system SHALL provide clear prerequisites and learning objectives for each section
3. WHEN a learner studies materials THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and reference materials
